# RBLXCheats
Just some silly little cheats for a lego game I've made, likely isn't the best option for most games out there.

# Executors List (must be tested by me or someone in the pull requests section to add their executor to their list)
## 🟢 = Fully working
## 🟡 = Partially working (may experience issues)
## 🟠 = Not worth using
## 🔴 = Not working
# NOTE: JUST BECAUSE AN EXECUTOR SUPPORTS THIS SCRIPT, DOESN'T MEAN IT IS TRUSTWORTHY. ONLY DOWNLOAD EXECUTORS THAT ARE TRUSTED BY GOOD SOURCES.
🔴 Swift - executor down

🟢 Velocity - open/close button doesn't work + every other function works

🟡 Xeno - god mode doesn't work + currently up, autoclicker works, all teleports work

# Loadstrings
 Heres a loadstring version of every script currently available from my repo, for convenience!

## SPTS classic:
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Versitilicus/RBLXCheats/refs/heads/main/SPTSclassic.lua",true))()
